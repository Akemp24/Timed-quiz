# Timed-quiz

## Description

A timed quiz that will penalize the user for the wrong answer. You will be able to save your score and initials and be able to view older scores. I learned how to use Web apis, time functions, and local storage for this project. 


## Usage
To see the website use the following link: https://akemp24.github.io/Timed-quiz/
Visit the website and click the start button. Answer the questions correctly and you will gain points, answer incorrectly and time will be deducted. When finished you will be able to save
your high score next to your initials.
